Just a specialized IR remote. See https://furrtek.org/?a=wslinger for details.

Can be converted to a simple Flipper Zero IR file. I don't have one for testing so that's up to you.

Build with Microchip Studio or use hex file to program an ATTiny85 directly. Connect button, 940nm IR LED, WS2812 LED, and battery according to pinout in header of `main.c`.

Untested in the American version of the ride.
